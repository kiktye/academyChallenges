Challenge 17 - JavaScript
For this challenge, you will solve tasks that are used for developing logic.
Solve them in order as the weight of each subsequent task increases.
Tasks can be in one document or 3 different ones.
1. Use conditions to check if a given number is even. If so , print with
console.log â€œ The Number (TheNumberYouWrote) is even ". If the
number is not even, print " The Number (TheNumberYouWrote) is not
even".
2. Check which numbers from 10 to 100 are even and divisible by 3. Print
with console.log all those that meet these conditions.
3. From the given 3 numbers , find the smallest and largest, and check
are they prime.
Example:
Number = 13;
Number2 = 15;
Number3 = 20;
Smallest - 13 , Largest-20
The smallest number 13 is prime , The largest number 20 is not prime.

## Comment from a mentor
You have written correct and excellent solutions in the three tasks, your code is nicely structured and organized. Note: In the second problem it is specified exactly which numbers should be taken as input in the first problem and in the third problem only examples are given to clarify the requirement. It is understood that in the first and third task the numbers should be entered through the prompt. You do not check in the first and third tasks whether the entry will be valid. And not all tasks should be in one js file.
