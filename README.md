Challenge 13- PHP
Part 1:
You need to create 4 pages.
The first page will be a sign up/login page. It should have a background
image and two buttons. (sign up and login). The forms are not on this page,
only 2 links (styled as buttons) that when clicked will take the user to a page
dedicated for either login or register action.
The sign up link/button should take the user to the second page where a
form with two inputs for username and password is shown. At the top of this
page the text ‘Sign up form’ is printed.
When the user submits the form, the data should be written into a users.txt
file (format: username=password). The password should be hashed, either
using md5 or password_hash (preferred option).
Every new user should be inserted in a new row in the users.txt file.
After form submission, the user should be redirected to a new page (third
page) where the message ‘Welcome $username’ will be shown.
The login link/button should take the user to a new page (fourth page) where
a form with 2 inputs for username and password is also shown.At the top of
this page the text ‘Login form’ is printed.
When a user submits the form – a check should be done if the data the user
entered matches some of the users in the users.txt file. Remember, the
passwords need to be hashed.
If the user is not found in users.txt file – show the message ‘Wrong
username/password combination ‘.

If everything is ok – Redirect the user to the third page where the same
message ‘Welcome $username’ is shown.
Part 2:
Add another input to the sign up page: email.
Create a new file where instead of storing only the username=password, you
will save the email too, in the following format: ‘email, username=password’.
When registering, add logic to check if the username already exists in the
users.txt file. If it does, print a message ‘Username taken’.
Also, check if the email already exists in the users.txt file. That means that
when submitting the form, the user has to provide a unique email. If the
email already exists in the users.txt file, print the following message: ‘A user
with this email already exists’. Use yellow font color for this message.
Part 3:
Add input validation. Every validation needs to be a separate function. The
validations to be implemented are:
● All inputs are required (no empty fields are allowed);
● Username cannot contain empty spaces or special signs;
● Email must have at least 5 characters before @;
● Password must have at least one number, one special sign and one
uppercase letter;
Then, adapt the code to print proper validation messages (in red color) for
each failed validation.
